By day I am an engineering director. By night and weekends, I like to pretend
I am still technical and hack on pet projects involving the cloud, automation,
RESTful APIs, and just about anything else that is cool, might be useful and/or educational.

I am a typical engineer, married to an engineer, with two children who aspire to be engineers. We have also have a Chihuahua.

During my non-computer time, I like to spend time with my family, drive, ride my bikes, go to the gym, and fix things around the house.
